description: Grilling session that challenges your plan against the existing domain model, sharpens terminology, and updates documentation (CONTEXT.md, ADRs) inline as decisions crystallise. Use when user wants to stress-test a plan against their project's language and documented decisions.

## Wiki/Forge session context

For wiki-forge projects:

- Resolve the vault through `KNOWLEDGE_VAULT_ROOT`; if unset, run `wiki config --effective --repo <path>` or `wiki init <project> --repo <path>`.
- Do not create durable project memory markdown inside the code repo unless the repo itself is the configured vault.
- Forge-tracked use: obey the active Forge phase packet, its required skills, artifact owner, allowed writes, and next command.
- Standalone use: this skill can run without Forge; when durable memory is needed, route it through Wiki under `${KNOWLEDGE_VAULT_ROOT}/projects/<project>/`.

<what-to-do>

Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

Ask the questions one at a time, waiting for feedback on each question before continuing.

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.

## Domain awareness

During codebase exploration, also look for existing documentation:

### File structure

Most repos have a single context:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

If a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── CONTEXT.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── CONTEXT.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily — only when you have something to write. If no `CONTEXT.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `CONTEXT.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y — which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'account' — do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible — which is right?"

### Update CONTEXT.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `CONTEXT.md` right there. Don't batch these up — capture them as they happen. Use the format in [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](./CONTEXT-FORMAT.md).

`CONTEXT.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details. Do not treat `CONTEXT.md` as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions. It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR. Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md).

## Wiki/Forge adapter

Storage mapping is the adapter; the grilling workflow above remains upstream. `CONTEXT.md` maps to `projects/<project>/architecture/domain-language.md`; `CONTEXT-MAP.md` maps to `projects/<project>/architecture/context-map.md`; per-context `CONTEXT.md` maps to `projects/<project>/architecture/contexts/<context>.md`; `docs/adr/` maps to `projects/<project>/adrs/` with `projects/<project>/decisions.md` as the index. Prefer `wiki forge grill record <project> --context-file <path> --context <name> --decision-title <title> --decision-file <path> --tag <id> --json` for stable refs.

### Forge phase packet details

Load this skill when the phase packet lists `grill-with-docs`. CONTEXT.md → projects/<project>/architecture/domain-language.md. docs/adr/ → projects/<project>/adrs/ with projects/<project>/decisions.md as the index.
